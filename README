Directory structure

sys/
  module/
    site.php

usr/
  module/
    site.php

lib/


sys directory contains all system/core modules
usr directory contains all user/custom modules
site.php file contains site routes, e.g

site(array(
  
  '/about' =>

  function(){
    echo "about this site...";
  },

  '/contact' =>

  function(){
    echo "mail me foo@example.com";
  }

));

will generate the following url's
  http://site/about
  http://site/contact

all routes in /usr dir will override /sys routes, so be careful!
because of that nice feature, it is really easy to extend core functionality without
the need to re-implement or copy-paste core code - just re-implement the routes you want
and extend the classes you need.

How to use:
  - redirect all requests to index.php (route.conf is example lighttpd config file)
  - see site.php file

Examples:
  - see different branches
